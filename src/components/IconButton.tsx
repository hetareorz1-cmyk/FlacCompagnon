// Every icon-only button in the app — the row's reveal/delete, the tag
// panel's close cross, the cover's extract/delete, the progress bar's
// cancel — used to each hand-roll its own <button className="...-btn">
// with its own size/radius/hover colors, which is exactly how they'd drifted
// out of sync (different border-radius, different hover background, one
// trash icon red only on hover while another was always red). One
// component, one CSS family (`.icon-btn` + a variant class) fixes a whole
// class of these at once, and keeps the next one from drifting too.
