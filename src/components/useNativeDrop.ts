// Native OS file drop.
//
// This is a Tauri window event, not an HTML5 one: `dragDropEnabled` hands drops
// to the OS layer, which is why the webview's own drag-and-drop API is dead
// here (and why row reordering uses raw mouse events — see useRowDrag).
//
// Where a drop landed is resolved by `dropZones.ts` — see that file for why
// the three targets declare themselves instead of being measured from here.
//
// What's left in this file is the one thing that can't be delegated: deciding
// what unit an incoming position is in. Tauri *types* them as physical pixels,
// but that isn't reliable — on macOS they arrive already in logical (CSS)
// ones, and dividing by the device pixel ratio there pushes every drop into
// the top-left quadrant. (Related, still open:
// https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10744.)
//
// There's no flag to ask, so the value is tested rather than assumed: a
// physical coordinate on a scaled display is, by construction, larger than the
// CSS viewport it came from. If the raw value still lands inside the viewport
// it was already logical; only when it can't be a CSS coordinate at all is it
// divided. An earlier attempt calibrated against `webview.size()` instead,
// which failed for an instructive reason — that call reports genuine physical
// pixels even where the drop positions don't, so the ratio came back as the
// device pixel ratio and nothing changed. The two conventions have to be
// compared against the *page*, not against each other.
