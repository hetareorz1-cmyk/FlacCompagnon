// Single-track preview playback.
//
// The audio itself lives in the Rust backend (a `cpal` stream owned by the
// audio thread), not here — which is why this module stops playback once on
// mount: a webview reload restarts the JS with no idea a track is playing,
// while the Rust side keeps going. Without that call the UI would look idle
// with audio still coming out and nothing left to stop it.
//
// `requestId` pairs each play with the backend's `playback://finished` event,
// so a stale notification from a track that was already superseded can't
// trigger auto-advance on the wrong row.
//
// Playback rules (see `activeQueue`): pressing Play with no selection starts
// at the top of the table and plays on to the end; with one row selected, it
// starts there and still plays on to the end; with several rows selected, it
// plays just that selection, in table order, and stops once it's exhausted.
// Whichever of those applies is decided once, when playback starts, and is
// deliberately not re-decided as the selection changes afterward — the user
// asked for a selection made *during* playback to have no effect on a
// session already under way, only on the next one.
