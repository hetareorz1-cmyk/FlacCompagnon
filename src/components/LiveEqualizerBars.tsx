// Audio-reactive equalizer bars for the currently playing row — Qobuz-style,
// but driven by the track's actual loudness rather than a canned animation.
//
// The level itself comes from the Rust audio callback: an RMS of the samples
// about to reach the speakers, computed right where they're already in hand,
// throttled to ~16 times/second and sent as the `playback://level` event (see
// `src-tauri/src/playback.rs`). `requestId` is filtered the same way
// `playback://finished` already is elsewhere — so a level meant for a track
// that was superseded by a newer `play` can't drive the wrong row's bars.
//
// This is one overall loudness value, not a real per-frequency spectrum (that
// would need an FFT running in the audio callback, real-time budget it hasn't
// earned yet) — the four bars fake independent movement by smoothing that
// same value at four deliberately spread-out rates, rather than showing
// four identical bars ticking in lockstep.

// Spread wide on purpose: values bunched together (as an earlier version of
