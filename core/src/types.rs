//! The data types that cross this crate's boundary.
//!
//! Grouped together rather than each living next to the code that fills them
//! in, because they are one thing: the contract between `core`, the Tauri
//! commands and the frontend. `src/types.ts` mirrors this file field for
//! field, and the serialized shapes here are also what a saved JSON report
//! contains — so a change to any of them has to be made in three places at
//! once, and having them in one file is what makes that visible.
//!
//! Serialization notes live with the fields they constrain (see
//! [`FileAnalysis::size_bytes`] for why `serde(default)` matters to old
//! reports).
