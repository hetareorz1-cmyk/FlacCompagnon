//! The PCM pipeline between a decoder and an encoder: reading a source into
//! samples, resampling them, and quantizing them to integers.
//!
//! Split out of [`super`] rather than left beside the batch-planning code it
//! has nothing to do with — this is the whole of the conversion path that
//! touches sample values themselves, and none of it is specific to one
//! output format ([`super::opus`]/[`super::mp3`] resample, all four
//! quantize, every one of them decodes first). The two helpers stay
//! re-exported from [`super`] so the encoders keep calling
//! `super::f32_to_ints` / `super::resample_linear` unchanged.
