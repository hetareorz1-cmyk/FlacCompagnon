//! Authenticity detections, mirroring the three independent tests of the
//! original *Lossless Audio Checker* (Lacroix & Prime, AES):
//!
//! * **Upscaling**   — a low-resolution signal (≤16-bit) stored at a higher bit
//!   depth. Detected from the effective vs. declared bit depth.
//! * **Upsampling**  — a low-rate signal placed in a higher-sample-rate
//!   container; its content is band-limited well below the claimed Nyquist.
//! * **Transcoding** — a lossy (MP3/AAC) source re-wrapped as lossless. Detected
//!   from a brick-wall spectral cut-off and, for AAC specifically, from a flat
//!   high-frequency "dead zone" in the sine-window MDCT domain (the *AAC-SIN*
//!   signature).
//!
//! Each test is independent: a file may trip none, one, or several. As in the
//! original, these are heuristics — the reasoning is always surfaced in `detail`.
