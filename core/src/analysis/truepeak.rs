//! True-peak (inter-sample peak) measurement, ITU-R BS.1770-style.
//!
//! Digital samples are points on a continuous waveform: between two samples the
//! reconstructed analog signal can swing *above* both of them. A track whose
//! sample peak reads −0.2 dBFS can therefore clip a DAC's reconstruction filter
//! at +1 dBTP. BS.1770-4 measures this by upsampling ×4 with a 48-tap lowpass
//! FIR and taking the peak of the oversampled stream — exactly what this module
//! does, as a streaming polyphase filter (12 multiplies per phase, 4 phases per
//! input sample, per channel).
//!
//! The filter is a windowed-sinc (Blackman) lowpass with cutoff at the input
//! Nyquist, unity gain per phase. Validated against an independent NumPy
//! implementation: a 0.98 full-scale quarter-rate sine sampled at its
//! zero-crossing offset reads 0.693 sample peak but 0.9714 true peak
//! (recovering the hidden crest), and hard-clipped material reads > 1.0
//! (an inter-sample "over").
