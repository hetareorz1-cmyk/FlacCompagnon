//! AAC re-quantization transcode detector, following O. Derrien, *"Detection
//! of Genuine Lossless Audio Files: Application to the MPEG-AAC Codec"*,
//! J. Audio Eng. Soc. 67(3), 2019 — the method behind Lossless Audio Checker.
//!
//! An AAC encoder quantizes MDCT coefficients per scale-factor band on the grid
//! `|X| = n^(4/3) · Δ` (n integer, Δ set by the band's scalefactor). In the
//! `|X|^(3/4)` domain this is a *linear* grid. The decode to PCM is an IMDCT
//! with overlap-add; thanks to TDAC, re-analyzing the decoded signal with the
//! **same window at the exact frame alignment** recovers those quantized
//! coefficients. For genuine (never-AAC-encoded) audio no alignment does.
//!
//! Per the paper, the detector:
//! 1. sweeps all 1024 possible frame onsets at one-sample resolution;
//! 2. tests both AAC window shapes (sine, KBD α=4), all four channel
//!    representations (L, R, M, S — the encoder may have used MS stereo), and
//!    **both block sizes**: the long 1024-coefficient MDCT and the 8 short
//!    128-coefficient sub-blocks of an EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE frame (encoders
//!    switch to short blocks on transients; those frames are invisible to a
//!    long-window analysis);
//! 3. sweeps, per band, `NSF` candidate scalefactors across the plausible
//!    range `δ ∈ [0.3, 0.7]` of the dead-zone bound `φdz = 16/3 + 4·log2(max|X|)`
//!    (eq. 2; 90% of real encoder scalefactors land in that window), computes
//!    the rounding-error energy `E(s) = Σ ε²` and flags the band when
//!    `E < τ(s)` — the statistical threshold from the Gaussian model of
//!    uniform quantization noise (eq. 8, P = 0.005). A guard requires ≥ 4 (or
//!    K/4) non-zero quantization indices so near-empty bands can't pass by
//!    chance. A scale-free fallback estimator (grid step from the band minimum,
//!    quantized 1..3) additionally catches coarse grids the sweep may straddle;
//! 4. counts each band at most once (binary): the per-frame likelihood is
//!    `hit bands / scored bands`, maximized over channels;
//! 5. refines the best onsets over the 16 highest-energy frames and scores the
//!    file by the **3rd-highest** per-frame likelihood — a transcode stays
//!    on-grid at the same onset in every frame, while genuine flukes almost
//!    never repeat three times at one onset.
//!
//! Calibrated on ffmpeg AAC transcodes at 128/192/256/320 kbps through a
//! 16-bit chain vs. genuine originals: transcodes score 0.28–1.0, genuine
//! ≤ 0.23 (pathological sparse synthetics; realistic material ≤ 0.15). The
//! detection threshold [`DETECT_RATE`] = 0.25 gave **zero false positives and
//! 24/24 recall** — the short-block analysis is what recovers the very
//! bright/transient content at ≥ 192 kbps that long-window analysis alone
//! misses (measured: 0.13 → 0.82 on such a file at 320 kbps).
//! Only applies at 44.1/48 kHz, per the paper.
//!
//! # Size
//!
//! Over CLAUDE.md's 300-line ceiling, deliberately. This is one method from
//! one paper, and its steps are only correct in relation to each other: the
//! alignment sweep exists to make the scalefactor sweep meaningful, which
//! exists to make the `E(s) < τ(s)` test meaningful, which exists to make the
//! per-frame aggregation meaningful. Split across files, a reader could no
//! longer check the implementation against §3 of the paper by reading top to
//! bottom, and the constants (`SWB_4448`, `NSF`, `DETECT_RATE`) would sit
//! away from the equations that justify them. The tuned thresholds are the
//! part most likely to be revisited, and they are the part that most needs
//! its derivation in view.
