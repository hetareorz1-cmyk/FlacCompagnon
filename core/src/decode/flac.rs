//! FLAC's fused decode path: one pass that feeds the streaming analyzer *and*
//! computes the STREAMINFO MD5 over the exact original integer samples.
//!
//! Fused because both need every sample of the file: doing them separately
//! would decode the whole track twice for no gain. claxon is used here rather
//! than Symphonia because it hands back the raw decoded integers, which is
//! what the MD5 must be computed over — a float round-trip would not be
//! bit-exact for the hash even though it is exact for the analysis.

///   round-trip — using the exact layout mandated by the FLAC spec:
///   interleaved samples, each written as `ceil(bits/8)` little-endian
///   two's-complement bytes. Bit-identical to what `flac -t` verifies.
/// * The analyzer receives `s / 2^(bits-1)` as `f32`, which is exact for
///   FLAC's ≤ 24-bit integers (every such integer fits in the f32 mantissa),
///   plus the raw integers for effective-bit-depth analysis.
///
/// When `verify_md5` is false the hash comparison is skipped (the decode cost
/// is the same either way since analysis needs every sample).
