//! Decoding audio into something the rest of the crate can analyze or play.
//!
//! One file per decode path, because they share the container-probing step and
//! almost nothing else:
//!
//! * [`stream`] — the generic path. Symphonia decodes any supported format and
//!   the samples are streamed into a [`StreamAnalyzer`], never held whole.
//! * [`flac`] — FLAC's fused path: one pass that feeds the analyzer *and*
//!   computes the STREAMINFO MD5 over the exact original integers.
//! * [`dsd`] — DSD (DSF/DFF), which Symphonia cannot decode; ffmpeg converts
//!   the 1-bit stream to PCM and we analyze that.
//! * [`playback`] — decoding for the preview player rather than for analysis:
//!   whole-file and progressive variants, no analyzer involved.
//! * [`probe`] — the shared "open the file, find its default track" step, plus
//!   the header-only [`probe_info`].
//! * [`container`] — what the file *actually* is, from its magic bytes, versus
//!   what its extension claims.
//!
//! Every path exposes audio as normalized `f32`. For integer PCM sources the
//! exact integer sample values are reconstructed from those floats (the
//! conversion is lossless for ≤ 24-bit content, since an `f32` mantissa
//! represents every integer up to 2^24 exactly) and fed to the bit-depth
//! estimator alongside.
//!
