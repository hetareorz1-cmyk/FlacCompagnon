//! FlacCompagnon's Tauri backend — wiring only.
//!
//! This file declares the modules, builds the app and lists the commands the
//! frontend may invoke. It deliberately holds no command bodies and no
//! application logic (see CLAUDE.md): those live in [`commands`], one file per
//! domain, and the real work lives further down still, in `flaccompagnon_core`
//! where it can be tested without a GUI.
//!
//! What this app does to the user's files, in one place:
//!
//! * **Analysis reads only.** Audio files are opened read-only and never
//!   modified by a scan.
//! * **Two things write to audio files**, both only on an explicit Save from
//!   the tag panel: [`commands::tags::write_tags_batch`], and indirectly an
//!   online lookup result the user chose to apply.
//! * **Everything else is written beside the tracks, never into them**: the
//!   CSV/JSON reports, the M3U playlist, the spectrogram PNGs, an extracted
//!   cover. The JSON report is re-importable by dropping it back onto the
//!   window.
//! * **One command renames a file without touching its content**:
//!   [`commands::rename::rename_file`], from the results table's "click twice
//!   on the name" — the audio and its tags are untouched, only the file's own
//!   name on disk changes, and only its stem: the extension is fixed
//!   server-side too, not just hidden in the UI.
//! * **[`lookup`] is the only module that touches the network**, and only when
//!   the user clicks "Search online".
