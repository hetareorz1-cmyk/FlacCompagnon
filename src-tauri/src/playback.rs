//! Single-track audio playback for the results table's hover-to-preview
//! button and the app's footer transport — entirely separate from the
//! detection/analysis engine, which never touches this module. Decoding
//! reuses `flaccompagnon_core::decode::PcmStreamDecoder` (Symphonia); output
//! goes through `cpal`.
//!
//! Decoding is progressive: `build_stream` only reads the container header
//! (via `PcmStreamDecoder::open`) before opening the audio device, then
//! hands the rest of the decoding to a background thread that feeds a
//! growing sample buffer while the stream is already playing from it — a
//! long or hi-res file starts sounding almost immediately instead of after
//! its whole body has decoded. The one exception is the resampling
//! fallback (see `build_stream`'s second half), which still decodes the
//! whole file up front — see the comment there for why.
//!
//! `cpal::Stream` is not safely movable between threads on every backend, so
//! it never leaves the thread that created it: one dedicated "audio thread",
//! started once from Tauri's `setup` hook, owns every `Stream` for its
//! entire lifetime and is only ever talked to through a channel of [`Cmd`]s.
//! `play`/`stop`/`pause`/`resume`/`seek` (called from the matching
//! `*_playback` Tauri commands, inside `spawn_blocking`) just send a command
//! and block on a one-shot reply.
//!
//! Pause and resume are `cpal::Stream::pause()`/`play()` — the stream itself
//! stays open, so resuming is instant and the decode buffer keeps whatever
//! it already had. Seeking moves a shared playback position (in frames,
//! behind a `Mutex` the output callback also reads every buffer) rather than
//! rebuilding the stream; volume and mute are two global atomics the same
//! callback multiplies into every sample it hands to the device, after
//! reading them and before the level meter measures them — muted or quiet
//! audio should look quiet on the results table's equalizer bars too, not
//! just sound quiet. None of this touches the decode thread or the
//! `StreamBuffer` it fills: seeking past what has decoded so far just plays
//! silence until the buffer catches up, exactly like the normal startup
//! buffering does.
//!
//! When a track finishes on its own, a `playback://finished` event lets the
//! frontend decide whether to advance to the next row — the queue itself
//! lives entirely in the frontend, which already knows the table's display
//! order. `playback://position` reports the current playhead on the same
//! throttled cadence as `playback://level`, driving the footer's seek bar.
//!
//! # Size
//!
//! Over CLAUDE.md's 300-line ceiling, deliberately. This is one subsystem
//! held together by a thread-ownership rule, not a collection of functions: a
//! `cpal::Stream` is not safely `Send` on every backend, so it must never
//! leave the thread that built it. Every piece here — the command channel,
//! the audio thread's loop, `build_stream`, the shared buffer the decode
//! thread fills — exists to keep that invariant true. Splitting them across
//! files would put the rule and the code it constrains in different places,
//! which is precisely how such an invariant gets broken by a later edit that
//! looked local and safe.
