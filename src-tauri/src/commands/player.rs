//! Start/stop/pause/seek the preview player, and its volume.
//!
//! Every command that touches the audio thread (play, stop, pause, resume,
//! seek) hops onto a blocking thread: the engine in [`crate::playback`] talks
//! to that thread over a channel and waits for the reply, which must not
//! happen on the async runtime's thread. Volume and mute are a pair of plain
//! atomics the output callback reads directly (see `playback::set_volume`'s
//! doc comment) — nothing to wait on, so those two stay synchronous.
