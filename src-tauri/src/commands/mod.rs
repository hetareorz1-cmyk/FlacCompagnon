//! Every Tauri command the frontend can invoke, one file per domain.
//!
//! Commands are deliberately thin (see CLAUDE.md): validate the arguments,
//! call into `flaccompagnon_core`, map the error to a `String` the frontend
//! can show. Anything with real logic belongs in `core`, where it can be
//! tested without a GUI.
//!
//! * [`analysis`] — run the detector over a set of targets.
//! * [`batch`] — the cancellation flag and progress plumbing those long jobs
//!   share, plus target expansion.
//! * [`spectrograms`] — render a PNG per track through ffmpeg.
//! * [`report`] — write CSV/JSON reports and M3U playlists, and read a report
//!   back in.
//! * [`tags`] — read/write tags and cover art. The only commands here that
//!   modify the user's audio files, and only on an explicit Save.
//! * [`files`] — reveal a file or open a folder in the OS file browser.
//! * [`rename`] — rename a file on disk, keeping its extension. The only
//!   command that changes where a file lives rather than what's in it.
//! * [`lookup`] — thin wrappers over the online providers in [`crate::lookup`].
//! * [`player`] — start/stop/pause/seek the preview player, and its volume.
